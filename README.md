# detect-quotes
Detect which type of quotes a string is using. 
 Some times it is very difficult to detect which kind of quotes a string is using especially when you're dealing with source files directly and transforming it in some way. Whether you're just manipulating a source code a little or you're doing full parsing, this problem will definitly surface.
 
 It is a very annoying situation  to always try to figure out whether you're dealing with a double or single quote or a tilder each time. Now there are many tools that will try to handle this already however I see a lot of such tools annoying because they usually employ a long chain of depencies to implement a small functionality. I feel that's unfair and I'm not afraid to roll out mine.
